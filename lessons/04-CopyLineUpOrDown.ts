// 1. Highlight the section of code that you would like to copy to a new line (lines 19-21)
// 2. Copy those lines 3 times (1 for each new field we need to map) (Press "Shift+Alt+‚Üì")
// 3. For each field change the name of the "mappedExercise1Shipment" object key and the field that you are mapping from exercise1Shipment
//    3a. Example: change "earlyPickup" to "latePickup" on line 21 and "earlyPickupDate" to "latePickupDate" on lines 22 and 23
//    3b. You can do this quickly by utilizing the Add Selection To Next Find Match Shortcut ("Ctrl+D")
